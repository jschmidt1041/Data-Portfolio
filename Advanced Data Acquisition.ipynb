    "\n",
    "## A. Copy of Dashboard\n",
    "Please see the copy of my \"Assessing the Health of Our Patients\" dashboard in .twbx format that supports executive decision-making that is being submitted as part of this PA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A1. Datasets\n",
    "Please see the datasets being submitted as part of this assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets used for this assessment are the WGU-provided Medical Dataset and the publically available Kaggle \"Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset\" (2015) derived from The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey performed annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n",
    "\n",
    "## A2. Dashboard Instructions - Labs on Demand\n",
    "To access the dashboard via Labs on Demand (LOD), please follow these instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open LOD and allow it to initialize on your device.\n",
    "2. Next, you can download the dashboard Assessing the Health of Our Patients.twbx file onto your device and then email it to yourself at your gmail email. Once completed, go to the LOD Microsoft Edge web browser and sign into your gmail account (at mail.google.com) as usual and download the .twbx file from your gmail - it should go into the downloads folder.\n",
    "3. By this point, having downloaded the .twbx file, open Tableau (it should be the white icon titled \"Tableau 2021.4\") and go to \"File\" at the top left of the window, followed by the \"Open...\" button. Alternatively, you can select the \"Open a Workbook\" link in orange. This should open the window so you can open the .twbx file. Please search in the window in the downloads folder (or wherever you downloaded the file) and double click on the file to open it.\n",
    "4. This should allow you to open and view the dashboard as it includes an extract of the data source. In other words, the .twbx file is all-in-one and should be ready to go for the next section, A3. Dashboard Navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, in case it is needed, this is the login information for LOD: \n",
    "\n",
    "Windows Credentials:\n",

    "- Password: Passw0rd!\n",
    "\n",
    "## A3. Dashboard Navigation\n",
    "This dashboard is titled \"Assessing the Health of Our Patients\". Once you open the dashboard following the instructions from part A2 above, you will land on the title page where you can find additional information regarding the contents of the dashboard. On every page, you can scroll up and down as applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To go to the next page, you can either select the next tab at the bottom or utilize one of the interactive navigation buttons also at the bottom by using ALT + click to activate them. The second page is titled \"Heart Disease Risk\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Once on the second page of \"Heart Disease Risk\", you can return to the home page via the tabs at the bottom or the interactive navigation buttons at the bottom of the page using ALT + click, or you can continue to the final page of \"Our Patient Population\" by clicking the titled buttons at the bottom of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, once you are on the final page of \"Our Patient Population\", you can return to the home page or return to the previous page via the tabs at the bottom of the page or the titles navigation buttons on the bottom of the page using ALT + click. Additionally, the \"Our Patient Population\" page features two interactive filters that affect all graphs on that page, namely \"Complication risk\" and \"Initial Admit Type\". Please utilize the toggle buttons on these filters to view the data in different ways depending on which selections you desire.\n",

    "## C1. Dashboard Purpose and Functions\n",
    "Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States (source: CDC). The purpose of the dashboard, \"Assessing the Health of Our Patients\", is to analyze trends and similarities between our patients and patients with known heart disease so that we may better serve our patients in terms of both preventive and active treatment measures. In other words, by analyzing traits of patients with heart disease, we can better detect and prepare for treating heart disease in our patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, the variables in the additional dataset from the CDC offers insights into patients with heart disease. We can utilize this data to compare it with our patients' data and get more insights like first, assess the overall health of our patient population compared with the health of heart disease patients, and second, look for trends and characteristics of heart disease patients to determine what to look for when preventing and detecting heart disease in our own patients. For example, we know that heart disease patients tend to have higher BMIs, so we can more closely monitor our patients with above average BMIs for heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "## C2. Justification of Tableau\n",
    "The business intelligence tool of choice for this data dashboard it Tableau - specifically, Tableau Desktop. Tableau is one of the most used and well known business intelligence tools in the industry and it allows you to create complex visualizations and interesting and engaging interactive data dashboards. Tableau is an excellent and powerful tool for visualizing/presenting data and can be used in a multitude of ways, which is why I will be using it for this PA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## C3. Steps to Clean and Prepare the Data\n",
    "The steps to clean and prepare the data for this PA are as follows. Please note that much of the data preparation could be performed in Tableau since the datasets are already very clean and have already been prepared.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I made sure that the Medical Dataset had the 10,000 records from the data dictionary, which it did. Then, I was careful to ensure that each of the relevant categorical variables (BMI, High Blood Pressure, and Diabetes) were labeled appropriately as \"Yes\" and \"No\" instead of 1 and 0 for visualization purposes. I also had to clean the Kaggle Heart Disease Indicators dataset in Tableau by creating aliases for High Blood Pressure (from 1 and 0 to Yes and No, respectively), and by creating a group for BMI to better align with the WGU Medical Dataset (25 and above BMI is Overweight). Finally, I renamed variables within the dashboard to better align with the visualization goals - instead of \"Count of Patient\" variable, I would use \"Patients\".\n",

    "The results of the analysis are good such that we were able to draw insights from the dashboard. Since we were looking for risk factors for heart disease in part C1, we can see the results of the dashboard show exactly that. We can see that our patient population is similar to the CDC patient population with heart disease in terms of BMI, but we have fewer patients with an overweight BMI - this is good, but it is also something that should be addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we can see that a larger percentage of heart disease patients have high blood pressure than our patients, which is a good sign. However, it is also important to know because we are able to keep a closer eye on our patients who have high blood pressure since they are at a higher risk of heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, we can see that more patients with heart disease have diabetes than our patient population, which is similar in effect to the high blood pressure noted above: it is a good sign, but we also need to keep a close eye on those who do have diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we get a generalized look at some of the demographics of our patient population which can be useful. Namely, we have age, gender, and martial status. The most common age of our patients is 47, we have more female patients than male, and our patients' marital statuses are almost even across the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "## C6. Limitations of the Data Analysis\n",
    "Some limitations of my analysis are the number of records in both datasets - the analysis would be more robust with more data. There also were some variables missing from the WGU Medical Dataset that would have been useful in comparison to the Kaggle dataset in detecting and analyzing heart disease, specifically Smoking and even heart disease/heart disease risk itself. This means that we had to analyze associated risk factors of heart disease/heart disease risk instead of being able to analyze it directly, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the analysis."
